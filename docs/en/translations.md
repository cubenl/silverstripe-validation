# Translations
Currently, the supported locales for the error messages are:

- EN
- NL

If this does not suit your needs, you could create your own `yaml` file which includes
the translations for the error messages.

For the supported structure see: `vendor/cube/silverstripe-validation/lang/en.yml`
